# Refreshed King James version (RKJ)
This is a work-in-progress update to the KJV to put it into modern english to make it more readable, just like the original goal of the KJV, to make the bible widely available and understandable to regular people. You can see a list of up-to-date changes [here](https://github.com/zacharysnewman/free-bible-versions/blob/main/txt/RKJ/word-changes.txt).

Here you will find the following bible versions in txt format:

- King James Version (KJV)
- Refreshed King James version (RKJ)

The KJV is in the public domain. The RKJ is subject to the permissive license [here](https://github.com/zacharysnewman/refreshed-king-james/tree/main?tab=License-1-ov-file).
