Philemon
[1:1] Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,
[1:2] And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in your house:
[1:3] Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:4] I thank my God, making mention of you always in my prayers,
[1:5] Hearing of your love and faith, which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;
[1:6] That the communication of your faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.
[1:7] For we have great joy and consolation in your love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by you, brother.
[1:8] Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin you that which is convenient,
[1:9] Yet for love's sake I rather beseech you, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
[1:10] I beseech you for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:
[1:11] Which in time past was to you unprofitable, but now profitable to you and to me:
[1:12] Whom I have sent again: you therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:
[1:13] Whom I would have retained with me, that in your stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:
[1:14] But without your mind would I do nothing; that your benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.
[1:15] For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that you should receive him for ever;
[1:16] Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto you, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?
[1:17] If you count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.
[1:18] If he hath wronged you, or oweth you ought, put that on mine account;
[1:19] I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to you how you owest unto me even your own self besides.
[1:20] Yea, brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.
[1:21] Having confidence in your obedience I wrote unto you, knowing that you wilt also do more than I say.
[1:22] But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.
[1:23] There salute you Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;
[1:24] Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.
[1:25] The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
